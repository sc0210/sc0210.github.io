## Autobiography
I find joy in creating things, especially when it comes to building useful applications that make our lives more convenient. During my time in college, I was introduced to the world of medical imaging and computer vision applications and was immediately intrigued by their clinical use. 

I started dedicating my free time to learning more about computer science fundamentals to better understand these technologies. Now, I am excited to announce that I will be starting my computer science master degree program in the upcoming fall semester of 2023.
