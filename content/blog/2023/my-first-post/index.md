## The story start from here...
I'd planned to start my personal blog-website, where I can share my thoughts and record interesting side projects. After some sort of research and comparing, I decide to choose **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** for the framework of my personal blog-website and currnetly deploy on **[github pages](https://pages.github.com/)**. I am looking forward for proper custom domain in the future.

Today is in a good mood, I lunach my blog-website project!! This is my-first-post, which tells about the very beginning of this website. Although the process was quite hard, I finally make it come true. In the following post I will gonna share **how I made** and **you can make your own custom website**.

Including the skills or techniques list in below:
- **[Hugo installation](https://gohugo.io/)**
- **[Markdown basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)**
- **[Github action](https://github.com/features/actions)**
- **[Git version control](https://git-scm.com/)**

## Future plan for this blog
