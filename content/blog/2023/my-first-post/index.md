## The story start from here...
I had planned to start my personal blog-website where I could share my thoughts and record interesting side projects. After doing some research and comparisons, I decided to use **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** as the framework  for my personal blog-website, and I am currently deploying it on **[github pages](https://pages.github.com/)**. I am looking forward for proper custom domain in the future.

Today, I am in a good mood because I launched my blog-website project! This is my first post, which talks about the very beginning of this website. Although the process was quite difficult, I finally made it come true. In the following post, I will share **how I create** and **you can make your own custom website**.

Including the skills or techniques list in below:
- **[Hugo installation](https://gohugo.io/)**
- **[Markdown basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)**
- **[Github action](https://github.com/features/actions)**
- **[Git version control](https://git-scm.com/)**
