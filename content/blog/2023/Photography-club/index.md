## The story begin here


**Before college**, I wasn't familiar with photography. I had no idea how to take a nice photo with a professional camera, nor did I understand the potential behind the industry.

To tell the story, I need to go back to when I was younger. My dad used to give us a basic camera whenever we went on a trip. At that time, all I knew was how to press the shutter button. Furthermore, all the photos we took were neither posted on social media nor shared with others, just like nowadays.

When I began studying at university, I joined various school clubs, including the **photography club**, videomaking club. That's where I started my journey towards becoming a photographer. My senior sister and brother eventually selected me to be a leader in the club.

During my free time, I enjoy traveling with friends and experimenting with different picture compositions, color grading, and photography topics. Over time, I developed a deep love for photography and realized the profound impact it could have on my life. I became hooked and eagerly shared my thoughts and ideas about photography with my fellow club members and classmates every chance I got.

Honestly, speaking in front of large crowds used to frighten me. I knew that I lacked the necessary qualifications and experience to share valuable information with others. However, I saw every opportunity as a chance to train myself before entering society. That's why I started giving lectures in college, particularly in the club. Although it was challenging at first, it allowed me to gain confidence and overcome my fears.
