## Brief about websiste

> A website is a collection of web pages that are linked together and accessed via the internet using a web browser. It can contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia content. Websites can serve a variety of purposes, including **sharing information, selling products or services, providing entertainment, or facilitating communication.**

>They can be [static]() or [dynamic](), with static sites having fixed content and dynamic sites being able to display content that changes based on user interactions. Websites are created using various programming languages, including [HTML](), [CSS](), and [JavaScript](), and can be **hosted on servers or accessed via cloud-based services.**

A website can generally be divided into two main components: the [frontend]() and the [backend](). 

### Frontend
- The frontend is responsible for directly interacting with users and presenting information in a user-friendly way. This typically includes designing the user interface, developing the user experience, and implementing the visual elements of the site.
    - Programming languages: [HTML](), [CSS](), and [JavaScript]()
    - Framework: [React](), [Angular](), and [Vue](),.etc

### Backend
- Meanwhile, the backend focuses on handling the data flow between the website and external sources, such as fetching weather data from a weather API, integrating Google Maps, or connecting to a database. 
    - Programming languages: [Python](), [Go](), and [Java](),.etc
    - Framework: [Flask](), [Laravel](), [ASP.NET](), and [Rails](),.etc

By separating these two components, web developers can create efficient and scalable websites that are easy to maintain and update.
